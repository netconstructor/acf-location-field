# ACF { Location Field

Adds a 'Google Maps' field type for the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) WordPress plugin.

-----------------------

### Overview

This add-on adds a Google Map Location field type to the Advanced Custom Fields plugin for both versions 3 & 4. This field allows you to find addresses and coordinates of a desired location.

The Location field provides:

* a search field where you can type in some coordinates or an address and hit `Enter`. 
* a Google map which you can click at the desired location.

In both cases, Google will find the location and return the coordinates and the complete address, if you want it complete. A marker will be added at the desired location.


### Compatibility

This add-on will work with:

* version 4 and up
* version 3 and bellow


### Installation

This add-on can be treated as both a WP plugin and a theme include.

**Install as Plugin**

1. Copy the 'acf-location' folder into your plugins folder
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins admin page
